      "q1": "Will my VCF or Excel file be uploaded to the server?",
      "a1": "<strong>Absolutely not.</strong> The core advantage of VCF2XLS is that <span class=\"text-accent-700 font-bold\">data is processed entirely within your local browser.</span> File content never leaves your device, ensuring the highest level of data privacy and security.",
      "q2": "What should I do if the imported contacts show garbled Chinese characters?",
      "a2": "Garbling typically occurs during the <span class=\"font-bold\">Excel/CSV to VCF</span> process. Please ensure your original CSV file is saved with **UTF-8 encoding**. Our tool generates VCF files in UTF-8 by default, which is the standard method for resolving Chinese character garbling. If the problem persists, try reopening the CSV in Excel, saving it as UTF-8, and then re-uploading.",
      "q3": "After VCF to Excel conversion, some fields like 'Notes' or 'Multiple Phones' are missing?",
      "a3": "Our tool's parser is designed to identify and extract all standard and non-standard fields in VCF.<ul class=\"list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1\"><li>For **multiple identical fields** (e.g., two mobile numbers), we will either merge them into the same cell or create separate columns in Excel (e.g., 'Phone 1', 'Phone 2').</li><li>If your VCF contains non-standard data, please send the VCF file to us for analysis, and we will update the parsing logic to support that field as soon as possible.</li></ul>",
      "q4": "Are there limits on file size or the number of contacts?",
      "a4": "Since conversion is performed locally, file size mainly depends on your device's performance (CPU and memory). Theoretically, there are no strict limits, but processing VCF files containing over **50,000 contacts** may take a significant amount of time, so please be patient."
